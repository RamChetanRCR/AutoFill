# 🚀 Job Application Auto-Fill Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that helps users fill job application forms faster by automatically entering repetitive information such as personal details, contact information, and commonly reused fields.

The extension uses the **GroqCloud API** to parse resumes (**PDF / DOCX**) and extract structured data, which is then mapped to job application form fields for quick and accurate auto-fill.
